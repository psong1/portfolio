      <h1 className="m-8 py-4 font-bold">About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Paul Song and I am from Milledgeville, Georgia. I have earned
        a B.S. Ed in Exercise Science from UGA and a Full-Stack Web Development
        Certificate from Georgia Tech, but I decided to pursue a B.S. in
        Computer Science to learn the foundational knowledge of computers. I
        have four years of professional work experience at Emory Healthcare
        where I served as a Patient Access Scheduler and helped managed an
        inpatient rehab facility. I really enjoy solving complex problems using
        technology, which is why I am pursuing a career as a software engineer.
